<!--The purpose of HTML 5 semantic tags is to provide meaning to HTML elements on one's page. They help with organization, as well as assisting disabled people with page navigation/usage. The ones that I see as most useful are main(provides most important content), section(allows for navigation of content), and header(provides navigation bars, etc.)
	The browser tends to used a top-to-bottom order to display elements on a page (which can be changed with CSS).
	Learning about snippets was extremely useful in this challenge, it helped to show me a specific way in which sublime can be malleable. I will create a few (maybe a basic table/form layout), but will not overdo it.
	The concept that was most difficult for me was definitely going through the snippets section. I had never seen how these actually work before and got fairly confused for a few minutes. I will improve my understanding of this concept by playing with snippets on my own as well as reading articles/looking at examples of how they are used in the real-world.-->
