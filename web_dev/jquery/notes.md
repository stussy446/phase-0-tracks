Plan to tackle jQuery (2 hours)

1) Google and find a quick explanation of jQuery as a whole 
2) Google and find/go over a cheat sheet(s) for popular jquery commands
3) Make a test file and test populary jquery commands 
	Most important piece (this relates to my learning style most)
4) Find jquery code and try to read through it, looking up things you don't understand.
5) Take handwritten notes of all of the above throughout for retention
6) Take a 10 minute break after an hour
