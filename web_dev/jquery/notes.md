Plan to tackle jQuery (2 hours)

1) Google and find a quick explanation of jQuery as a whole 
2) Google and find/go over a cheat sheet(s) for popular jquery commands
3) Make a test file and test populary jquery commands 
	Most important piece (this relates to my learning style most)
4) Find jquery code and try to read through it, looking up things you don't understand.
5) Take handwritten notes of all of the above throughout for retention
6) Take a 10 minute break after an hour

Finishing notes

The strategy that seemed to work best for me was alternating between taking in new information and testing that information, and then moving on to a new topic. 

I found it much easier to build up and understand the basic syntax/usefulness of selectors/actions, etc by taking the information bit by bit and seeing how each piece fit into the puzzle.

It was also useful to me to bookmark the couple pages that had references to selectors and methods, as I definitley found myself going back and looking at them to help me fill in gaps when I reached a part that stumped me.

The handwritten notes have alway been a great boon for me as it helps influence my mind to retain more information and to really study the information that I am writing down.

The only thing that was not that effective was reading some of the more complicated code, as I think that I may be at a point where too much of it went over my head and I did not know where to start.
