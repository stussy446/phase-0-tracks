# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# require_relative brings something local (probably within directory) into a file while require 
# brings in things outside of your library into your file.
require_relative 'state_data'
